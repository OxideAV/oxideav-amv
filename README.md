# oxideav-amv

A pure-Rust demuxer **and** muxer for the **AMV** ("Actions Media
Video") container — the non-standard AVI variant used by inexpensive
portable media players (S1 / Actions / ALi-chip devices) — built on the
[oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-workspace) framework.

AMV pairs a custom intra-only Motion-JPEG-like video stream (fixed,
hardcoded quant / Huffman tables) with an IMA-ADPCM-style mono audio
stream wrapped in a `RIFF` form whose type is `AMV ` (trailing space). It
reuses the AVI 1.0 RIFF vocabulary (`LIST`, `hdrl`, `strl`, `strh`,
`strf`, `movi`, the `<nn>dc` / `<nn>wb` chunk-tag convention,
`WAVEFORMATEX`) while discarding most of its semantics: all RIFF / LIST
sizes are zeroed, leaf chunks are not padded to an even byte boundary,
stream-header bodies are blank, there is no `idx1` index, and the stream
is bounded by an `AMV_END_` ASCII trailer instead of a RIFF chunk
length. See the
[trace document](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-workspace/blob/master/docs/container/amv/amv-container-trace.md)
in the workspace for the full byte-by-byte layout.

This is a **container-only** crate. Frame and sample *decoding* live in
sibling codec crates: the video stream is declared as the `mjpeg` codec
id and the audio stream as the `adpcm_amv` placeholder.

## Capabilities

### Demuxer

- Parses the `amvh` main header (resolution, fps, packed duration) and
  the audio `WAVEFORMATEX`, walks the `movi` payload, and emits one
  `oxideav_core::Packet` per `00dc` (video) / `01wb` (audio) leaf chunk,
  terminating cleanly at the `AMV_END_` trailer.
- **Seeking** via `Demuxer::seek_to` — rewinds and walks forward,
  skipping chunk bodies via `Seek` (video JPEGs are never allocated on
  the seek path); intra-only video lands exactly at the requested PTS,
  audio at the first chunk whose cumulative sample count reaches it. An
  optional `build_chunk_index()` records every chunk offset + PTS so
  repeated random-access seeks short-circuit the disk walk.
- **Truncation tolerance** — short reads at any chunk boundary are
  treated as EOF; every complete preceding chunk is still emitted, and
  `is_truncated()` / `trailer_offset()` / `trailer_matches_eof()`
  classify the three terminal states (still walking, clean trailer EOF,
  truncated EOF).
- **Strict mode** — `open_strict` (and `AmvHeader::validate_sentinels` /
  `AmvWaveFormat::validate_sentinels`) gate on the device-profile
  sentinel constants from the trace before any `movi` work, including the
  §2 `amvh` reserved 7-dword span (`+0x04..+0x1C`) and the §3 all-zero
  stream-header bodies; the default `open` stays permissive.
- **Consistency checks** — `video_frames_emitted()` and
  `duration_consistent_with_drained_frames()` tie the `movi` walk back
  to the `amvh` packed-byte duration via the trace invariant
  (frames ÷ fps = duration). `audio_blocks_emitted()` and
  `movi_interleave_balanced()` add the §4 strict 1:1 video:audio pairing
  cross-check at the demuxer level: after a clean trailer-bounded drain
  the `01wb`-block count equals the `00dc`-frame count ("1116 / 1116,
  perfectly paired"), so a truncation that cut off after a trailing video
  frame surfaces as an imbalance — without buffering the whole chunk-kind
  sequence the way the free-function `validate_movi_interleave` requires.

### Muxer

`AmvMuxer` is the byte-faithful inverse: given a `[video, audio]`
`StreamInfo` pair it writes the zeroed RIFF / LIST sizes, the packed
`amvh` duration (patched in `write_trailer` from the observed frame
count), the all-zero stream-header bodies plus the 20-byte audio
`WAVEFORMATEX`, the no-byte-padding chunk walk, and the `AMV_END_`
trailer. Mux → demux round-trips byte-identically.

### Standalone byte parsers

The byte-level types are usable without the framework: `AmvHeader`,
`AmvDuration`, `AmvWaveFormat`, `AmvAudioPreamble`, `AmvVideoFrame`,
`ChunkHeader`, `ChunkKind`, the `MoviPayloadIter` chunk walker, the
chunk-tag / trailer / JPEG-marker constants, and free-function
validators for video-payload shape, internal-marker scanning, and the
1:1 video-audio `movi` interleave rule. `AmvVideoFrame::bind` makes the
header-to-payload dependency explicit (the `00dc` bitstream carries no
frame header — resolution comes from `amvh`), exposing the entropy-coded
window between SOI and EOI for a future decoder. AMV's per-block audio
preamble (`state`, `decoded_sample_count`) is surfaced verbatim, with
nibble-budget / sample-interval cross-checks for recovery tooling.

### Fuzz + bench

A `cargo-fuzz` harness under [`fuzz/`](./fuzz/) drives every public byte
parser and the full `open` + drain path for panic-free behaviour on
arbitrary input. A Criterion suite under [`benches/`](./benches/) A/Bs
the demux drain, index build, indexed-vs-linear seek, and mux write hot
paths, synthesising all inputs through the public muxer (no committed
fixtures).

## Public API

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;
use oxideav_amv::AmvDemuxer;

let f = File::open("sample.amv").unwrap();
let mut demuxer = AmvDemuxer::open(BufReader::new(f)).unwrap();
println!("{}×{} @ {} fps", demuxer.header().width, demuxer.header().height,
         demuxer.header().fps);
println!("audio: {} Hz", demuxer.audio_format().samples_per_sec);
```

When wired into a `RuntimeContext` via `oxideav_amv::register`, both the
demuxer and muxer register under the container name `amv` — FORM-type
probing + `.amv` extension hint for reads, `open_muxer("amv", …)` for
writes.

## Provenance

Every byte-format fact is derived from
`docs/container/amv/amv-container-trace.md`, reverse-engineered from
observed bytes of redistributable `.amv` samples. No external
multimedia-library source code or any third-party AMV demuxer was
consulted. Field names such as `amvh`, `strh`, `strf`, `movi`, `00dc`,
`01wb` are the literal four-byte ASCII identifiers observed in the file;
their structural roles follow Microsoft's published RIFF / AVI
references staged in
[`container/riff/`](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-workspace/blob/master/docs/container/riff/).
